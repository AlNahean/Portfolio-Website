# Nahean's Study Hub

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for my personal study notes on Botany, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the content by modifying the `.mdx` files inside the `content/` directory. The pages auto-update as you edit the files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font).

## About This Project

This project serves as a personal knowledge base, organizing complex botany notes into a clear, searchable, and fast web format. It's built with modern web technologies to demonstrate an effective way to learn and share knowledge.

The source code is publicly available on GitHub for anyone interested in the implementation.

## Introduction

Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals, and microorganisms of the world. Using morphological, behavioral, genetic, and biochemical observations, taxonomists identify, describe, and arrange species into classifications, including those that are new to science.

### Why Classification Matters

Without a standardized system, scientific communication would be chaotic. Common names vary by region, but scientific names (Latin binomials) are universal.

## The Hierarchy

1. **Kingdom**: Plantae
2. **Division**: Tracheophyta
3. **Class**: Magnoliopsida
4. **Order**: Rosales
5. **Family**: Rosaceae

## Conclusion

Understanding taxonomy gives us a framework to appreciate the diversity of life on Earth.

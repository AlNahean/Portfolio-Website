## Why Switch?

Linux offers unparalleled control over your development environment. It is the backbone of the internet, so why not develop on it?

Understanding the kernel is the first step. It manages resources, memory, and CPU time.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Keep your system updated and secure.
